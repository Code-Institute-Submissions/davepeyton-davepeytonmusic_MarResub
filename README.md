# - Tools Used - 

<br>

### I designed this site using html and css. I utilised these tools to the best of my coding knowledge to date. I aplied animation effects and styling to help the page come to life and make the UX more enjoyable.
<br>

# - Issues I encountered -
<br>

 ### Where do I start! . To be honest , I found every aspect of building this site  to be challenging. From page layout, to writing basic html and linking internal and external pages, positioning and using css, linking broken links, css code not working the way you envisioned it to do so. Getting the site to this stage of development have been challenging on every aspect, but it has been very rewarding also , especially when you see the fruits of your labour .

 # - Why I created this site -

 <br>

### My intension was to kill two birds with one stone with the development of this site . 
### 1: My first milestone project for code institute.
### 2: I needed a website to advertise my music/Gigs/videos and to help generate new listeners/fans.
 <br>
 
# - My Goal -
<br>

### This site has been a fun project that I plan on updating on a regular basics. As my coding knowledge grows so will this site. I look forward to appling new techniques and fun animation in the future ................
