# Dave Peyton "Music" INTRODUCTION!.<br>
### My intension was to kill two birds with one stone with the development of this site . 
### 1: My first milestone project for code institute.
### 2: I needed a website to advertise my music/Gigs/videos and to help generate new listeners/fans.

# **Tools/Languages Used**

<br>

###  HTML5- CSS3- This is a responsive website. I designed this site using html and css. I utilised these tools to the best of my coding knowledge to date. I aplied animation effects and styling to help the page come to life and make the UX more enjoyable.

# **Issues I encountered**
<br>

 ### To be honest, I have found every aspect of building this site to be challenging. From writing basic html, page layouts, linking internal and external pages, positioning using css, fixing broken links, css code not working the way you envisioned. I even encountered issues when trying to commit files from gitpod to github. I spent alot of my time debugging error messages. Getting the site to this stage of development has been extremely challenging for me, but it has been very rewarding also, especially when you see the fruits of your labour .
